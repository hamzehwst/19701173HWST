									Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and data from digital attacks. It encompasses various technologies, processes, and practices designed to safeguard devices, networks, and data from unauthorized access, data breaches, theft, or damage.</p>

									
									<p>Key aspects of cybersecurity include:</p>
									
									<p>1.Protection: Implementing measures to prevent unauthorized access, ensuring data integrity and confidentiality.</p>
									
									<p>2.Detection: Employing tools and systems to identify and respond to security breaches or anomalies.</p>
									
									<p>3.Response: Developing strategies to mitigate the impact of security incidents and swiftly respond to cyber threats.</p>
									
									<p>4.Recovery: Having plans and systems in place to recover from cyber-attacks, restore operations, and minimize damage.</p>
									
									<p>Common cybersecurity measures include firewalls, antivirus software, encryption, multi-factor authentication, regular software updates and patches, network segmentation, employee training on security best practices, and incident response plans.</p>
									
									<p>As technology advances, cybersecurity continually evolves to counter new and emerging threats, making it crucial for individuals, businesses, and organizations to stay vigilant and adopt robust cybersecurity practices to protect sensitive information and digital assets.</p>
									 
									<img src="images/ifconfig.jpg" alt="interface configuration" width="550" height="450">
									<p>ifconfig is a command-line tool used in Unix and Linux systems to configure and display information about network interfaces like IP addresses, network status, and more.</p>
									<br></br>
									<img src="images/whoami.jpg" alt="interface configuration" width="300" height="150">
									<p> command in Unix-like operating systems displays the username associated with the current active session or terminal. When executed, it shows the username of the user who is currently logged in or running the command.</p>
									<br></br>
									<img src="images/how naby hops from your machine to assigned website .jpg" alt="interface configuration" width="550" height="450">
									<p>in this photo we can see  how naby hops from your machine to assigned website </p>
									<br></br>
									<img src="images/what are the primary nameservers for website .jpg" alt="interface configuration" width="550" height="450">
									<p>in this command we can know the primary nameservers for the website . </p>
									<p>Primary nameservers manage a website's domain name system (DNS), translating names to IP addresses. They're critical for directing traffic to the correct web server.</p>
									<br></br>
									<img src="images/who is the registered .jpg" alt="interface configuration" width="550" height="450">
									<p>The whois command retrieves domain registration details, including the registrar, registration date, and contact information for a specific domain name.</p>
									<br></br>
									<img src="images/ping.jpg" alt="interface configuration" width="550" height="450">
									<p>The ping command is used to check the connectivity between two networked devices. It sends small packets of data to a specific address and measures the time taken for the data to travel to the target and back. This helps in assessing network latency and verifying if the target device is reachable.</p>
									<br></br>
									<img src="images/what is the mx record for the website .jpg" alt="interface configuration" width="550" height="300">
									<p>The nslookup command with the -type=mx parameter is used to specifically query Mail Exchange (MX) records for a domain. To utilize this command, replace "domain.com" with the actual domain you want to inspect:bash</p>
									<p>and  the command is (nslookup -type=mx domain.com) so we just shang the domain and we write the name of the wep we want to know  </p>

								<p>IoT works by connecting everyday devices to the internet, allowing them to collect and share data. These devices have sensors that gather information, which is then sent through networks to be processed and analyzed. Users can interact with these devices remotely and make decisions based on the data they provide, aiming to improve efficiency, convenience, and functionality in various aspects of life and industries.
                                </p>
								<p>Sensors and Devices: IoT devices are embedded with sensors that collect various types of data, such as temperature, light, motion, or other environmental factors. These sensors can range from simple temperature sensors to complex cameras or industrial machinery.

									Connectivity: IoT devices use various communication technologies like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, or cellular networks to transmit the collected data to a central system or other devices. This connectivity allows the devices to interact with each other or with a centralized hub.</p>

												<p>The birth of the World Wide Web in 1990 by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN, Switzerland, marked a transformative moment in the internet's history. It involved the proposal and development of a system to access and share information globally using hypertext documents. This invention laid the groundwork for the internet's exponential growth and the interconnected digital world we rely on today.</p>

												<p>One early example of applying IoT-like technology to vending machines was in 1982 when Carnegie Mellon University connected a Coca-Cola vending machine to the internet. This project, known as the "Coke Machine," used early internet technology to remotely check the status of the machine and see if it was stocked with cold drinks. </p>

												<p>John Romkey is credited with connecting the first toaster to the internet in 1990. He demonstrated this at the Interop conference, showcasing how a Sunbeam toaster could be turned on and off remotely via the internet. Romkey's demonstration was one of the early instances of connecting a household appliance to the internet, illustrating the concept of remote control and automation, which became foundational for the Internet of Things (IoT) development. This experiment highlighted the potential for everyday objects to be connected and controlled through network connectivity, paving the way for the interconnected world we now inhabit.</p>

								<h3 class="major">about and what i have larnde form cyber security </h3>
								<img src="images/hamzeh.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Hey there! I'm Hamzeh Walid Tareawneh, an IT student at EMU. While I'm passionate about delving into the world of IT and cybersecurity, my current project aims to showcase the potential of super-secret technologies and the Internet of Things (IoT) in the future.

Beyond this project, my interests revolve around continuous learning, especially in safeguarding digital spaces from potential cyber threats. I'm enthusiastic about exploring ways to protect both myself and others from hacking attempts, nurturing a passion for ensuring online security.

Throughout this journey, I've encountered challenges, particularly in understanding various commands and exploring the complexities of cybersecurity, including attempts to test default website vulnerabilities. These hurdles have provided invaluable learning experiences, pushing me to find ethical and responsible ways to navigate the IT landscape.

Ultimately, my goal is to not only highlight the future potential of technology but also contribute to a safer digital environment. If there's anything I can assist you with or if you have any IT-related queries, feel free to reach out!</p>
<h3 class="major">what i have larnd and the things that i had calnges  </h3>
 <p>
	My journey into cybersecurity was sparked by relentless hacking attempts on my laptop and phone. I delved into understanding firewalls and website safety, striving to safeguard against potential breaches.
	
	In an ambitious pursuit, I once sought to create a backdoor for my old laptop, recognizing the importance of structured learning. Presently, I'm expanding my skills through "Learn Ethical Hacking From Scratch" on Udemy.
	
	For newcomers, cybersecurity presents an exciting journey, especially for tech enthusiasts. Vigilance in assessing downloads and websites became crucial after facing breaches that prompted formatting my laptop for security.
	
	I'm indebted to Dr. Beran Tanseloğlu, who provided guidance and introduced me to ITEC442, setting the foundation for my cybersecurity exploration.
	
	Excited by the ever-evolving landscape, I foresee cybersecurity continuously advancing, reshaping how we safeguard our digital presence.</p>
